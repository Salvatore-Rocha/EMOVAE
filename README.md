# EMOVAE

Emotion detection from faces is a common problem in the area of affective computing that relies on visual cues from faces to detect specific emotional states
of individuals. This problem, first described in 1992, is commonly solved by experts trained in the observation of specific facial features produced
when a subject involuntarily contracts face muscles. The set of muscles that are activated during the expression of an emotion are also known as Action Units
(AUs).
Since the problem of emotion detection on faces heavily relies on visual cues, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to automatize the clasiffication problem.
